# Automated ECG quality assessment

This repository conains code to assess the noise level present in ECG recordings. ECG recordings can get a binary label of either *acceptable* or *unacceptable*. Where *acceptable* means that the ECG recording contains little noise and is suitable to be used for analysis and diagnosis. And *unacceptable* means that the ECG recording contains too much noise and is unsuitable for analysis. 

The code is divided in two folders. The toolbox and CNN-LSTM:

## Toolbox 
This folder contains the code for a toolbox to display ECG recordings. Running the `main.py` file will display the following toolbox:
